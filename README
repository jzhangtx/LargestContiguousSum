Largest Contiguous Sum


A subarray is a part of an array including one or more contiguous/adjacent elements.

Example
Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Subarrays:
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[1, 2]
[2, 3]
[3, 4]
[4, 5]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
If we find the sum of the elements of any subarray then that sum will be known as a contiguous sum.

Example
[1] => 1
[2] => 2
[3] => 3
[4] => 4
[5] => 5
[1, 2] => 3
[2, 3] => 5
[3, 4] => 7
[4, 5] => 9
[1, 2, 3] => 6
[2, 3, 4] => 9
[3, 4, 5] => 12
[1, 2, 3, 4] => 10
[2, 3, 4, 5] => 14
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15
You are given an array of numbers (could be -ve as well). You need to find the largest contiguous sum from the array.

In the above example, the largest contiguous sum would be 15.

Example
Array: [4 -6 2 5]
Answer: 7
Testing
Input Format
The first line contains 'T' denoting the no. of test cases.

This is followed by T test cases each containing 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains a number 'n' denoting the number of elements. The next line contains n space-separated numbers denoting the array elements.

Output Format
Next T lines each contain a number 'sumâ€™ denoting the largest contiguous sum of the array.

Sample Input
